# ModuloTech Technical Test

## DI

I use Hilt for dependency injection which allows me to inject 
the necessary instances into classes and test them.

## Fetch data from API

To fetch data from the JSON, I used two libraries :
Retrofit, the most popular library in Android development to communicate with
REST services and Moshi, a JSON converter that converts JSON strings into
Kotlin objects.

## Test

I use Mockk library to generate mock instances of other classes and Junit for test execution.
